  This example shows how to use value converters to use form elements which require non-primitive values. The following example
  contains a select that allows to select multiple elements. The value of such a form element is an array of the selected
  options. However, since arrays cannot be used directly as values for form controls we use a built-in value converter that
  converts the array to a JSON string.
